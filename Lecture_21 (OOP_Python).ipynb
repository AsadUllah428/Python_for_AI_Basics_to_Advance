OOP is a programming paradigm that allows you to organize and structure code in a more modular way, making it easier to manage complex projects, especially in AI systems."

    "# Understanding Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is about hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Abstract Classes**: Base classes that can't be instantiated directly\n",
    "2. **Abstract Methods**: Methods that must be implemented by child classes\n",
    "3. **Interface Definition**: Defining what a class must do, not how to do it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "- Reduces complexity\n",
    "- Provides a clear contract for implementation\n",
    "- Makes code more maintainable\n",
    "- Allows focus on what actions are needed without worrying about how they are implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world analogy:\n",
    "Think of a coffee machine - you just need to know which buttons to press (abstract interface) without understanding the internal brewing process. The complexity is abstracted away from the user."

    "### Practice Exercises:\n",
    "1. Create a class `Person` with methods to set and get name, age, and address.\n",
    "2. Build a class `BankAccount` with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.\n",
    "3. Implement inheritance by creating a subclass `SavingsAccount` that adds interest functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment:\n",
    "Create an OOP-based Python project like a simple inventory management system or a student grading system."
